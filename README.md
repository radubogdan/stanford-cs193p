**WIP**

**Fall 2013 iOS course by Paul Hegarty**

Contents:

1. [Matchismo](https://github.com/radubogdan/stanford-cs193p/tree/master/Matchismo) is a `single MVC` Game. It was
the example app in first three lectures. In this repository there is also my homework (1 and 2).

  It helped me understand basic concepts:
    - Model is UI-independent
    - View is (so far) completely generic UI elements
    - Controller interprets Model for View (and vice-versa)
    - Objective C (Classes, properties, methods, types and memory, NSString, NSArray, Creating Objects in the Heap etc)
    - Polymorphism
    
2. [Attributor](https://github.com/radubogdan/stanford-cs193p/tree/master/Attributor). Updated with lecture 6.

  It helped me understand:
    - UITextView
      - Set its text and attributes via its NSMutableAttributedString
      - Advanced layout in UITextView with TextKit
    - View Controller Lifecycle (viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, viewWillDisappear, view{Will,Did}LayoutSubviews, didReceiveMemoryWarning, awakeFromNib)
    - NSNotification (radio station :D)
    - NSAttributedString, NSMutableAttributedString, NSTextStorage
    - UINavigationController & Segues
